# IAED - Second Project

The second project of the IAED class (Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures).

The goal of the project was to create a simple File System without a GUI.
You could interact with the File System via the command line.

The project was written in C and explored concepts like sorting algorithms, efficiency, and C structures.

# How to run

To run the project, run `make` and run the created binary.  

This project didn't include a `help` flag. You need to literally type `help` in the command line; However, the text is written in Portuguese.  
If you want to fully understand what the code does, it is well commented in English.
